Trove | Service for generating, storing and validating one-time codes

https://github.com/eduhund/onetimekeys/assets/141957200/405b23ce-a439-49ea-a53f-df77ed6bbac9

### How Trove works.

The service has only 3 functions:

1. Issuance of one-time codes.
2. Validation of one-time codes.
3. Generating random codes without saving (the one the [site](http://otk.eduhund.com/) demonstrates).

We made the service more flexible and included customization in it. When prompted, you can select a specific key. For example, only letter values or only numbers. You can select the number of characters. From 4 to 32. And make this code one-time, reusable or available for some time.
